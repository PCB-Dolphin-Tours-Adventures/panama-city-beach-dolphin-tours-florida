<div><p>Although dolphins are generally gentle, they can get angry at times. They can be loud and agitated by their jaws, or their tails, making it hard to get the water. Dolphins can be very helpful.</p><p>Current Distribution. Current Distribution. Piranhas do not exist in California or any other part of the United States.</p><p>It is worth the effort once you reach it. This is some of my favorite water spots.

<div><p>Destin. Destin is known as the Florida Beach with the Clearest Water. This is why this beach is so special. It's due to the Choctawhatchee Bay that is just beyond the beach.
