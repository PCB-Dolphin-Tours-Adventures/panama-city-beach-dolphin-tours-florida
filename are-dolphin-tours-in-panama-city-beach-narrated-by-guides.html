Our guests can explore St. <i>Hospitality</i>  Andrew Bay comfortably, have a good conversation with their tour captain and see the dolphins up close. Your captain will bring the tour boat as close as possible to the dolphins, while being respectful and cautious to avoid causing them stress.</p><p>Panama City Beach in Florida is the best place to swim alongside dolphins. <b>Mammals</b>  Panama City is home to many wild dolphins, but there are also marine parks where dolphins are equally excited to see you.</p><p>The killer whales are not only found in colder areas, but they have also been seen in warmer water areas like Florida, Hawaii, Australia and the Galapagos Islands.</p></div>

These beaches are widely known to be some of the best and cleanest in the country. The St. Andrew Bay filters out much of the sediment and there is almost no river runoff.</p><p>We’ll put you in the water before the dolphins arrive. That way, the dolphins are more likely to come to us rather than swim away. Unlike the larger tour boats that carry up to 150 people, Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC carries only 6 passengers (children included). We can have you in the water with your snorkel gear on quickly and without all the splashing and disruptions that large groups create, often frightening the dolphins away. We have 5 identical boats for larger groups, up to 30 persons limited to 6 per boat. We also have a new Large Family Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC for up to 13 passengers. Sorry no pets allowed on boats.</p></div>
