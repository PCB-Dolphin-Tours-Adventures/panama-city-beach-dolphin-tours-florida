Most of the reefs have public parking nearby and toilets. These reefs can be found anywhere between 200 and 300 yards from the shore.</p><p>Florida law forbids dolphin swimming and feeding. The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission has officers on the water to enforce these rules.

<div><p>Florida's freshwater fish can be consumed without any harm. Mercury levels are low in marine fish like Bluegill, Redear sunfish and Redbreast Sunfish.</p><p>Dolphins usually congregate near-shore along the coastline. Shell Island in Panama City Beach offers a wonderful spot to find wild dolphin pods. <i>Beverage</i>  Shell Island, which is 7 miles long, offers incredible beach bliss and is just across the waterway from Saint Andrew's Park.</p><p>To satisfy their curiosity, dolphins might swim alongside boats. Dolphins are often drawn to the wake of a boat, which causes a disturbance on the surface of the water. They will jump out of the water and appear to be playing in the wake when they do this.</p></div>
