<div> <p>DO NOT TOUCH THE DOLPHINS. If dolphins desire to have physical contact with humans, they will request it. When you touch one dolphin, all of them will leave the area. It not only negatively affects dolphin behavior but it also irritates other people in your group, since everyone loses during the swim.</p><p>They can be found in the waters of our beaches such as South Walton, Miramar Beach and Inlet Beach. The best time to see them is between May-August, when they come closer to the shoreline for mate. You are not allowed to touch dolphins even though they may be friendly.</p><p>For many years, we have been taking guests on dolphin tour with us.<br><br><h2>Are there evening sunset dolphin tours available in Panama City Beach - Excitement</h2><ul><li>Experience</li><li>Education</li><li>Beacon</li><li>Harbor</li><li>Horizon</li><li>Cruise</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Captain</li><li>Hospitality</li><li>Seaside</li></ul> We follow all safety precautions to ensure that our guests are safe and the dolphins are well-being.
