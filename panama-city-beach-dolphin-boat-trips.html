We saw multiple dolphins, jumped in with them, saw turtles, rays and crabs. He also took us to a private beach to search for shells and carried our bucket full back for us. It was great to customize for what we wanted to do as we had a 14, 12 and 10 year old.

Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC only has six passengers (including children) and is not like larger boats with up to 150 passengers. We can quickly get you on the water wearing your snorkel gear without the disruptions and splashing that large groups cause. This is often what scares the dolphins away. We have 5 identical boats to accommodate larger groups. There is also a Large Family Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC that can hold up to thirteen passengers. Please no pets allowed on boats.</p></div>
