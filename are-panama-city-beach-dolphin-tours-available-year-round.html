like to be touched?",
"Keywords": ["Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Do not touch the dolphins. The dolphins will attempt to make physical contact with you if they feel the need. Touching one dolphin will cause them to leave the area. This not only affects dolphin behavior, but also causes irritation to other members of your group as everyone loses in the swim."

<div> <p>To satisfy their curiosity, dolphins will sometimes swim alongside boats. The wake from a boat can cause a significant disturbance to the water's surface, which dolphins may feel the need for investigation. Dolphins will often jump out of water to investigate the wake, making it appear that they are playing in it.</p><p>The danger to sea lions is usually low. <i>Horizon</i>  Sea lions are not aggressive and tend to keep to themselves. <i>Harbor</i>  However, being wild animals that weigh 600 pounds they need to be respected. <b>Mammals</b>  There have been occasions when sea-lions have inflicted serious injuries on humans.</p><p>"This was an incredible experience. The captain was excellent. We snorkeled with dolphins, searched for shells, even went on a dive! We saw so many sea creatures. Highlight of our trip!"</p></div>

<div> <p>The sea turtle season in Destin runs from April to November. But, people are more likely to encounter these amazing creatures between July and August. Destin's famed East Pass is Manmade. They created a path that would take them from Choctawhatchee Bay, all the way to Mexico. They had the right idea. The floodwaters were released on the same day as the digging began. They rushed through and created what we now know the East Pass.</p><p>Here are 14 of Florida's most beautiful beaches. Delray Beach, Palm Beach County. Lummus Park Beach. Miami Beach.
